# Data Structures and Algorithms Java Implementations
This project contains the java implementations of the following:
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Heap

... More implementations to be added in the future.

## Note
Library to be used for learning purposes only. I do not claim the implentations of the data structures are 100% efficient. My aim with this is to learn how such data structures could be implemented and as a result broaden my understanding of them.
